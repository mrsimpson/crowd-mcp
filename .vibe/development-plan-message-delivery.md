# Development Plan: crowd (message-delivery branch)

_Generated on 2025-10-30 by Vibe Feature MCP_
_Workflow: [bugfix](https://mrsimpson.github.io/responsible-vibe-mcp/workflows/bugfix)_

## Goal

Fix the delivery of initial messages (tasks) to agents when they spawn. Agents should connect to the internal MCP server via SSE and receive their assigned tasks, but currently no logs show this happening and agents don't react to the task delivery.

## Reproduce

### Tasks

- [x] Understand the expected SSE connection flow from agent to MCP server
- [x] Identify what components are involved in task delivery
- [x] Examine server-side SSE endpoint implementation
- [x] Review agent-side SSE connection logic
- [x] Attempt to reproduce the issue with a test agent spawn
- [x] Check for any missing configuration or environment variables
- [x] Analyze logs to confirm no SSE connections are being established
- [x] **FOUND ROOT CAUSE**: `host.docker.internal` is not reachable from agent containers

### Completed

- [x] Created development plan file
- [x] Understand the expected SSE connection flow from agent to MCP server
- [x] Identify what components are involved in task delivery
- [x] Examine server-side SSE endpoint implementation
- [x] Found Agent MCP Server implementation at /mcp/agent-mcp-server.ts

## Analyze

### Phase Entrance Criteria:

- [x] Bug has been successfully reproduced in a controlled environment
- [x] Expected vs actual behavior is clearly documented
- [x] Relevant error messages, logs, and stack traces are captured
- [x] The conditions that trigger the bug are well understood

### Tasks

- [x] Research Docker networking solutions for host.docker.internal on different platforms
- [x] Investigate if the issue affects Linux, macOS, and Windows differently
- [x] Determine the best solution for Docker container to host communication
- [x] Evaluate alternative approaches (docker host network, bridge network, IP address)
- [x] Check if this affects local development vs production deployment
- [x] **NEW FINDING**: Confirmed network connectivity works, issue is OpenCode MCP connection
- [x] Investigate why OpenCode is not connecting to messaging MCP server
- [x] Check OpenCode MCP client configuration and connection logic
- [ ] Verify if OpenCode supports remote MCP servers via SSE
- [ ] Check if messaging MCP is being initialized by OpenCode at startup
- [x] **SOLUTION APPROACH DEFINED**: Need to verify OpenCode's MCP remote server support
  - Primary fix: Ensure OpenCode connects to remote messaging MCP server
  - Fallback 1: Use alternative task delivery mechanism (stdin, env vars)
  - Fallback 2: Switch to local MCP server if remote SSE not supported

### Completed

- [x] **CORRECTED ROOT CAUSE**: OpenCode not connecting to messaging MCP server
- [x] Confirmed DNS resolution works (host.docker.internal -> 192.168.65.2)
- [x] Confirmed Node.js can connect from agent containers to MCP server
- [x] Ruled out Docker networking issues
- [x] Identified issue is in OpenCode MCP client configuration/connection
- [x] **FOUND**: OpenCode starts successfully but no MCP connection logs
- [x] OpenCode loads TUI interface and configuration correctly
- [x] No errors in OpenCode logs related to MCP server connections

- [x] **SUCCESS**: Complete end-to-end task delivery working perfectly!
- [x] **VERIFIED**: Agent automatically retrieves, executes, and reports task completion
- [ ] **Integration**: Ensure fix doesn't break other MCP servers (responsible-vibe)

## Key Decisions

### Root Cause Identified

- **Issue**: Agent containers cannot reach the Agent MCP Server via `host.docker.internal:3100`
- **Symptom**: No SSE connections established, agents don't receive tasks
- **Evidence**:
  - Agent MCP Server is running and healthy (confirmed via localhost:3100/health)
  - Agent container has correct environment variables and configuration
  - Network connectivity test from container to `host.docker.internal:3100` fails
  - ~~DNS resolution for `host.docker.internal` fails inside container~~ ❌ **INCORRECT**
- ~~**Platform**: This is likely a Linux Docker issue where `host.docker.internal` is not available by default~~ ❌ **INCORRECT**

### **FINAL SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED - MESSAGING APPROACH**

**Decision**: Switched from SSE-based task delivery to messaging system + stdin approach

**Root Cause**: OpenCode uses lazy loading - MCP connections only established when tools are used, not on startup

**New Solution Architecture**:

1. **Task Delivery via Messaging System** (`mcp-server.ts`):
   - Send task to agent's inbox using existing messaging infrastructure
   - Uses `messagingTools.sendMessage()` with high priority
   - **✅ Includes completion notification instruction** - agents automatically instructed to report completion
   - Reliable delivery independent of MCP connection timing

2. **Startup Task Retrieval via stdin** (`entrypoint.sh`):
   - Modified container entrypoint to send "get your messages" command via stdin
   - Forces OpenCode to check messages immediately on startup
   - Works with OpenCode's stdin interface - always available

3. **Automated Completion Workflow** ⭐ **COMPLETE**:
   - Tasks include clear instructions for completion reporting
   - Agents automatically know to send completion message to 'developer'
   - Full workflow automation: spawn → deliver → execute → report

**Technical Implementation**:

- **Files Modified**: `mcp-server.ts`, `entrypoint.sh`, `agent-mcp-server.ts`
- **Approach**: Leverages existing messaging infrastructure + stdin
- **Compatibility**: No breaking changes to MCP interface

**Expected Benefits**:

- ✅ Immediate task delivery via stdin (works every time)
- ✅ No dependency on OpenCode MCP connection timing
- ✅ Leverages robust messaging system for persistence
- ✅ **Automated completion notification** - agents know to report back
- ✅ Full workflow automation from spawn to completion
- ✅ Future-proof for additional messaging features

## Notes

_Additional context and observations_

### Current Understanding

- Agent MCP Server is implemented in `/packages/server/src/mcp/agent-mcp-server.ts`
- Server starts on port 3100 (default) or AGENT_MCP_PORT environment variable
- Agents should connect via GET `/sse?agentId=<id>`
- Container manager sets up SSE URL: `http://host.docker.internal:3100/sse?agentId=${agentId}`
- Task delivery happens via SSE notifications (lines 238-340 in agent-mcp-server.ts)
- Agent MCP Server is properly started in main index.ts (lines 137-154)

### Expected Flow

1. Agent spawns, gets AGENT_MCP_URL environment variable
2. Agent connects to SSE endpoint with agentId
3. Server validates agent, creates MCP server instance
4. Server sends task notification via SSE
5. Agent receives task and starts working
