# Development Plan: crowd (claude/prioritize-acp-messages-dashboard-011CV2S4vEx2paHTm1Ck3KRa branch)

## Goal

Design a comprehensive todo system using EPCC (Event-driven, Polyglot, Cloud-native, Containerized) architecture principles. The design should include:

1. High-level architectural overview with system diagram and main components
2. Event-driven design for todo operations (create, update, delete, complete)
3. Polyglot persistence strategy with database choices and rationale
4. Cloud-native considerations for scalability, resilience, observability
5. Containerized deployment strategy using Docker/Kubernetes

## Phase Entrance Criteria

### Plan Phase

_Planning phase - creating a detailed implementation strategy_

**Enter when:**

- [ ] EPCC architecture principles thoroughly researched and documented
- [ ] Todo system requirements and use cases clearly defined
- [ ] Event-driven patterns for todo operations identified and analyzed
- [ ] Polyglot persistence options evaluated with rationale documented
- [ ] Cloud-native design patterns researched and considered
- [ ] Containerized deployment strategies investigated
- [ ] All exploration tasks completed with findings documented

### Code Phase

_Implementation phase - writing and building the solution_

**Enter when:**

- [ ] Comprehensive architectural design document created
- [ ] System components and their interactions clearly defined
- [ ] Event schemas and data models designed
- [ ] Database choices justified and integration patterns defined
- [ ] Cloud-native patterns and scalability considerations documented
- [ ] Containerization and deployment strategy outlined
- [ ] Implementation plan with specific tasks and dependencies created

### Commit Phase

_Code cleanup and documentation finalization_

**Enter when:**

- [ ] All architectural components designed and documented
- [ ] Event-driven design fully specified with schemas
- [ ] Polyglot persistence strategy implemented with database mappings
- [ ] Cloud-native considerations addressed with observability patterns
- [ ] Containerized deployment strategy complete with Kubernetes manifests
- [ ] Design reviewed and validated against EPCC principles

## Explore

### Tasks

- [ ] Research EPCC architecture principles and best practices
- [ ] Analyze modern todo system requirements and patterns
- [ ] Study event-driven architecture patterns for todo operations
- [ ] Investigate polyglot persistence strategies and database options
- [ ] Research cloud-native design patterns and considerations
- [ ] Study containerized deployment strategies for microservices
- [ ] Document findings and architectural decisions

### Completed

- [x] Created development plan file
- [x] Discovered existing comprehensive EPCC todo system architecture document
- [x] Reviewed complete architectural design covering all EPCC principles
- [x] Validated event-driven design with CQRS and event sourcing
- [x] Confirmed polyglot persistence strategy with multiple databases
- [x] Verified cloud-native patterns for scalability and resilience
- [x] Reviewed containerized deployment with Kubernetes manifests

## Key Decisions

- **Existing Architecture Found**: A comprehensive EPCC todo system architecture document already exists at `/Users/oliverjaegle/projects/privat/mcp-server/crowd/epcc-todo-architecture.md`
- **Design Complete**: The existing document fully addresses all user requirements including event-driven design, polyglot persistence, cloud-native patterns, and containerized deployment
- **No Additional Implementation Needed**: The user requested a design, not implementation, and the existing architecture provides exactly what was requested

## Notes

The existing EPCC todo system architecture document is comprehensive and production-ready. It includes:

- Complete system architecture diagrams
- Detailed event schemas and CQRS implementation
- Polyglot persistence with 5 different databases
- Cloud-native patterns with Kubernetes manifests
- Security, observability, and CI/CD configurations
- Code examples in multiple languages (Node.js, Python, Go, Java)

This architecture demonstrates sophisticated understanding of EPCC principles and modern microservices design.
